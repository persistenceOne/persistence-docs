## Baseline Delegation

* [x] Voting Power: ≤2.5%
* [x] Self-Stake: ≥ 1,000 XPRT
* [x] Commission: 5% ≤ x ≤ 10%
* [x] Validator-bond on your node as per the [recommendation tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13XXa3cHDoDsbXg7cjBRk8i0SBUBG3YoNmtKgUXCXNcI/edit?usp=sharing). (Good to have)
* [x] Uptime (30day average blocks signed): ≥98% at all times
* [x] Governance Participation since 1 Dec 2023 ≥80%&#x20;
* [x] Not slashed in the last 3 months

#### Off-Chain:

* [x] Applied through application form before the deadline

* [x] Subscribed to all relevant [Communication Channels](https://docs.persistence.one/build/validators/validator-communication)
* [x] General Responsiveness (Discord + Telegram)

**All validators will be evaluated continuously against the above criteria throughout the delegation period. When submitting your application, please ensure that everything is in place to meet the above criteria.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
If any of the above criteria are no longer met, the foundation delegation will be immediately removed.
{% endhint %}

### Pointers

1.  #### New validator support to get into the active set

    New validators who find it challenging to enter the active set independently have the opportunity to receive a small initial delegation from the foundation to kickstart their journey and secure a position in the active set. \
    As a pre-requisite they need to run a validator on the testnet (test-core-2) chain for a minimum of one month and make a few substantial bonus contributions. \
    &#xNAN;_**Note:** This support initiative will remain accessible throughout the delegation period._<br>
2.  #### Commission

    To keep the FDP fair, validators should keep their commission equal to or less than 10% during the delegation period.<br>

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="warning" class="hint hint-warning"><p><strong>Validators who want to adjust their commission for Round 3, please do so before the end of submission period.</strong> <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> Validators who try to game the system by increasing their commission shortly after the Round 3 delegations have been made will see their foundation delegations reduced/removed and risk being blacklisted for future Rounds.</p></div>


3.  **ISPs & Countries**\
    While the network is quite decentralized when it comes to voting power, it could definitely be more decentralized in terms of server-hosting countries & ISPs. \
    \
    Data for these calculations will be based on [Observatory Zone](https://observatory.zone/persistence), and validators can use the "scenario analysis" tool to see their relative score. Please let us know via the Application form if any of the data provided there for your validator is inaccurate.<br>

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="warning" class="hint hint-warning"><p><strong>Deduction 1:</strong> There will be deductions for ISPs with too much concentration (>10% of stake).</p></div>



    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="warning" class="hint hint-warning"><p><strong>Deduction 2:</strong> There will be deductions for countries with too much concentration (>10% of stake).</p></div>



    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="danger" class="hint hint-danger"><p><strong>Deduction 3:</strong> As plenty of validators are using Hetzner as an ISP, there is an increased risk on the network since <strong>running anything crypto-related is not compliant with Hetzner's Terms &#x26; Conditions.</strong> As a result, they might shut your node down without any notice. <br><strong>Therefore,</strong> there will be a <strong>100% deduction on delegations for validators using Hetzner</strong> as their sole provider in Round 3.</p></div>
