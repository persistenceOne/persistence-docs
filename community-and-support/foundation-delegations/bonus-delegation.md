We are thrilled to announce a special bonus delegation opportunity for all validators who choose to relocate their nodes out of high-density regions and Internet Service Providers (ISPs).&#x20;

At our core, we believe in decentralization, and with 100 validators active set, this initiative aligns perfectly with our mission to distribute network nodes across a wider geographic area.

### Why Relocate

\
Relocating your validator node from high-density regions and ISPs can greatly enhance the overall resilience, security, and decentralization of our network (i.e. Nakamoto coefficient).&#x20;

By spreading our network presence across diverse locations, we ensure that our blockchain remains robust and less vulnerable to regional disruptions.

### What's In It for Validators?

\
As a token of our appreciation for contributing to the network's health and decentralization, validators who make this move will receive a special bonus delegation. This bonus delegation will not only boost your staking rewards but also help you play a vital role in strengthening the network.

### Where to Find More Information?

\
To learn more, we encourage you to visit Observatory & Network Visualizer. These resources will provide you with detailed insights for your validator nodes:

1\. [Validator Observatory](https://observatory.zone/persistence) \
2\. [Network Visualizer](https://tools.highstakes.ch/geoloc/) (by High Stakes)

### How to Participate?

\
1\. Identify if your node is the high-density segment (Red, orange, or yellow).\
2\. Figure out which location could be most appropriate for your node.\
3\. Provide a heads-up to the team on our validator group on Telegram or Discord along with the new region details and ETA.\
4\. Start the migration, once completed provide the details to the team.&#x20;

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.
