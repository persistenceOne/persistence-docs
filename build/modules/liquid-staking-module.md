# Liquid Staking Module

#### Background

Developed by [Iqlusion 44](https://twitter.com/iqlusioninc), the LSM (Liquid staking module) is enabled (in v8 pacaya upgrade) to safely and efficiently help facilitate multiple features for the Core-1 chain.&#x20;

As the main feature for now, this module enables XPRT delegators to swiftly migrate from (old) 750 coin-type to (new) 118 coin-type without waiting for 21 days un-bounding period.&#x20;

(Learn more about coin-type migration [here](https://docs.persistence.one/coin-type-migration-from-750-to-118))

To provide a better understanding, comparing migration of coin-type with & without LSM:

<details>

<summary>Migration process without LSM</summary>

* Un-delegate tokens from 750 coin-type wallet address
* Wait for **21 Days** unbounding period
* Transfer tokens to 118 coin-type wallet address
* Bound tokens again with 118 coin-type wallet address.

**Note:** With this process the drawback is that the delegator is tend to lose rewards for 21 days while the tokens are un-delegating.&#x20;

Check the wallet wise migration steps [here](https://docs.persistence.one/coin-type-migration-from-750-to-118).

<summary>Migration process with LSM</summary>

* Press the 'Transfer Delegations' button from pWALLET using 750 coin-type migration
* Enter your 118 coin-type migration and press send
* The tokens will now be converted to 'tokenised shares' and will be visible under the 'Tokenised Shares' tab in 'Staking' page.
* Redeem your tokens
* Voila! You have successfully transferred the tokens&#x20;

**Note:** The feature is only available using [pWALLET](http://wallet.persistence.one).

As an additional security feature, validators who want to enable their delegators to migrate their wallet from 750 coin-type to 118 coin-type  using LSM, are required to ‚Äúvalidator-bond‚Äù a certain amount of XPRT.&#x20;

The validator ‚Äúvalidator-bond,‚Äù means that validators need to have ‚Äúskin in the game‚Äù in order to be entrusted with delegations.

This disincentivizes malicious behaviour and empowers the validator to get more delegations.&#x20;

### Understanding Validator-Bond

Technically speaking, the validator-bond is tracked by the LSM. The maximum number of tokens that can be delegated to a validator by a delegator is equal to the validator-bond multiplied by the ‚Äúvalidator-bond factor.‚Äù The initial validator bond factor would be set at 250 and can be configurable by governance.&#x20;

With a validator-bond factor of 250, for every one XPRT a validator validator-bonds, that validator is eligible to receive up to two-hundred-and-fifty XPRT delegated shares from the delegator.&#x20;

{% code title="Formula:" overflow="wrap" %}
```markup
total_liquid_stake_on_validator.amount / Sum(every_delegation_where[bond=True].amount) < VALIDATOR_BOND_FACTOR
```
{% endcode %}

### How to Validator Bond (Detailed Instructions)

A delegator (or validator operator) can convert a delegation into Validator Bond by signing a ValidatorBond message. The ValidatorBond message is exposed by the staking module and can be executed as follows:

```
persistenceCore tx staking validator-bond ValidatorAddress --from mykey  
```

Here‚Äôs an example of a successful validator bond transaction on core-1:&#x20;

* First, we must delegate to a validator from a new account: [https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/transactions/11D746B6C94CA4BBC18B02F08A0024A4730BAE1ADDEFEDAFAE85EC58A7DACAA5](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/transactions/11D746B6C94CA4BBC18B02F08A0024A4730BAE1ADDEFEDAFAE85EC58A7DACAA5)
* Then, we validator bond from that account: [https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/transactions/11D746B6C94CA4BBC18B02F08A0024A4730BAE1ADDEFEDAFAE85EC58A7DACAA5](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/transactions/11D746B6C94CA4BBC18B02F08A0024A4730BAE1ADDEFEDAFAE85EC58A7DACAA5)



Here‚Äôs the transaction that was submitted on the command line:

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="false" %}
```
 persistenceCore tx staking validator-bond ValidatorAddress 
 
  --from MyKey 
  --fees 1000uxprt
  --chain-id core-1
  --node https://rpc.core.persistence.one:443
```
{% endcode %}

You can confirm your conversion to a validator bond succeeded by querying the delegation.&#x20;

```
persistenceCore q staking delegations DelegatorAddress


delegation_responses:
- balance:
    amount: "N"
    denom: uxprt
  delegation:
    delegator_address: persistence123...ABC
    shares: "1.000000000000000000"
    validator_address: persistencevaloper123...XYZ
    validator_bond: true  <---- You should see this field = true :)
```

### FAQs

<details>

<summary>How much should I validator bond?</summary>

For every 1 XPRT you validator-bond, you will be eligible to receive up to 250 XPRT tokenized shares from delegators.&#x20;

For example, if you validator bond 1,000 XPRT, you will be eligible for 250,000 XPRT tokensized shares.&#x20;



We built a tool that recommends how much you should validator bond.&#x20;

<summary>When do I need to validator bond?</summary>

We recommend validator bonding immediately as users (Delgators on your validator) will attempt to migrate their wallet address coin-type from 750 to 118.

At that time, if a validator does not have sufficient validator bond, delegators will not be able to migrate. In this condition delegators can also redelegate the tokens first to a validator which has validator-bond in order to continue the migration process.&#x20;

This acts as an advance for validators to attract more delegation from users in the long run.
