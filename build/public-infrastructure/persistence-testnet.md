Testnets are a type of blockchain used exclusively for testing purposes. They function as a sandbox environment, allowing developers to test new code and functionalities without worrying about affecting the live blockchain (Mainnet). They are persistent environments, meaning that they remain active for extended periods of time.

Testnets come with a range of integrated services, including relayers to other testnets, frontends, explorers, and snapshot services.
