# Grants

## Introduction

If you’re someone who wants to work on exciting problem statements while solving the fundamental issues around capital inefficiency within the current PoS ecosystem, the Persistence ecosystem is the place for you.&#x20;

Persistence is committed to unlocking the true potential of staked assets through liquid staking, and we are excited to launch the Persistence Grants Program to work with builders around the world and achieve this vision together.&#x20;

Persistence core team will work closely with all selected applicants of this program, assisting them along with all phases of development:

* Grants to develop and scale selected projects, leveraging the Persistence tech-stack
* Technical support through consistent product development assistance from the Persistence core team
* Marketing and promotional support via immediate access to our growing community and media partnerships&#x20;
* Strategic partnerships with validators, protocols, accelerators, advisors and investors within the Persistence ecosystem

<table><thead><tr><th width="176">Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Micro Grant</td><td><p>For projects requiring a small amount of effort, and expected</p><p>to deliver on a shorter timeline (1-2 weeks).</p></td></tr><tr><td>One-off Grants</td><td>For projects requiring more effort that those in micro grants, and expected to deliver in moderate timelines (3-4 weeks). These projects once built can be later handed over to the Persistence Core team for maintenance.</td></tr><tr><td>Ongoing Grants</td><td>For projects requiring high effort such as building a standalone dApp on top of Persistence. Timelines for these projects will be decided on a case-to-case basis based on discussions with the selected applicants. Selected applicants will have to build a functional product to receive the grant. The Persistence core team can then choose to work closely with these applicants to scale the products further.</td></tr><tr><td>Open Grants</td><td>For ideas outside the proposed requirements from Persistence. Builders are invited to come up with ideas tha they think</td></tr></tbody></table>
