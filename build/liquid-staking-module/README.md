# Liquid Staking Module

Developed by [Iqlusion 44](https://twitter.com/iqlusioninc), the LSM (Liquid staking module) is enabled (in [v8 Pacaya upgrade](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/proposals/42)) to safely and efficiently help facilitate multiple features for the `Core-1` chain.&#x20;

As a main feature, this module enables XPRT delegators to swiftly migrate from (old) 750 coin-type to (new) 118 coin-type without waiting for 21-days undelegating period.&#x20;
