# Oracle Price Feeder

The `x/oracle` requires that all validators vote on the price of assets which governance has decided to add. In order to vote on these prices, the persistenceOne team has built the [Oracle price feeder](https://github.com/persistenceOne/oracle-feeder).

## How to setup

1. First, install the oracle-feeder:

    a. Install the binary from [releases](https://github.com/persistenceOne/oracle-feeder/releases)
    - Download the binary
    - Make the binary executable: `chmod +x oracle-feeder`
    - Move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`

    b. Or install using source code
    - clone oracle-feeder: `git clone https://github.com/persistenceOne/oracle-feeder`
    - install: `cd oracle-feeder && make install`

1. Setup account

    - Setup your keyring - checkout [this doc](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/run-node/keyring.html)
    - You can setup a separate key for oracle account or use the validator's key as the oracle account

        > **Note**  
        > It is recommended to setup a separate key for oracle account, which will submit vote on behalf of validator.  
        > Make sure you have some tokens in this account to be able to submit pre-vote & vote txs, `100xprt` should be enough for `~1M` txs

    - Delegate consent to the oracle account (Not needed if you are using validator's key as oracle account)

        ```sh
        persistenceCore tx oracle delegate-feed-consent <validator-key> $(persistenceCore keys show <oracle-key> -a --keyring-backend file) --keyring-backend file
        ```

1. Create config file

    - Download the example config (or copy from source code)

        ```sh
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/persistenceOne/oracle-feeder/main/price-feeder.example.toml
        ```

    - Update `[account]` information with correct chain-id (`core-1` for mainnet, `test-core-1` for testnet), address and validator address from your keyring

        ```toml
        [account]
        address = "persistence152nvc6f096v6n6tr5lg50xq22ak0chsr0ru7xc" # oracle account address
        chain_id = "test-core-1"
        validator = "persistencevaloper1pkkayn066msg6kn33wnl5srhdt3tnu2v94kvz9"
        ```

        In order to get your oracle address & validator address, you can run:

        ```sh
        persistenceCore keys show <oracle-key> -a --keyring-backend file
        persistenceCore keys show <validator-key> -a --bech=val --keyring-backend file
        ```

    - Update `[keyring]` information (learn about keyring backend [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/run-node/keyring.html))

        ```toml
        [keyring]
        backend="file"
        dir="<path to .persistenceCore dir>"
        passphrase="xxxx"
        ```

        > **Note**
        > Passphrase can be provided via environment variable as well
        >
        > ```sh
        > export ORACLE_FEEDER_KEY_PASSPHRASE=xxxx
        > ```

1. Create a [systemd](https://systemd.io/) service file

    - Run this command to create `oracle-feeder.service`, make sure to update the config path.

        ```sh
        sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/oracle-feeder.service > /dev/null <<EOF
        [Unit]
        Description=PersistenceOne Oracle Price Feeder
        After=online.target[Service]
        StartLimitIntervalSec=0
        StartLimitBurst=0

        [Service]
        Environment="ORACLE_FEEDER_KEY_PASSPHRASE=xxxx" # remove this line, if not using env variable
        Type=simple
        User=$USER
        ExecStart=$(which oracle-feeder) <path/to/oracle/config.toml> --log-level=debug
        Restart=on-failure
        RestartSec=5s
        LimitNOFILE=65535

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
        EOF
        ```

        > **Note**  
        > The price feeder hits a lot of endpoints to get prices for assets. Sometimes the websocket connections disconnect and cannot reconnect. If this is happening, set up the service file to restart the process after a few hours
        >
        > ```yaml
        > Restart=always
        > RuntimeMaxSec=14400s # 4h
        > ```

1. Start your service

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable oracle-feeder
    sudo systemctl start oracle-feeder
    ```

1. Please check to make sure your oracle feeder is running successfully

    ```sh
    sudo journalctl -u oracle-feeder.service -f
    ```
