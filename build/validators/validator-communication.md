<details>

<summary>üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Amelia (Persistence Super Bot) for Telegram</summary>

Persistence chain has 100+ and 40+ validator groups on telegram for mainnet & testnet respectively. Sending chain updates to all the groups manually becomes a tedious task and is comparatively slow at an emergency (Chain halt, Emergency Upgrade, exploit etc).

Hence, we launched a telegram bot (Amelia) which can relay the following details in a much faster way:&#x20;

1. Broadcast important announcement for Mainnet & Testnet.
2. Chain updates - Missing blocks, commission change, etc
3. Reminders - Automatically sends reminder for voting 24 hours prior to end time for validators who haven't voted.&#x20;

**Looks appealing?** [Contact team](../../community-and-support/connect-and-follow.md) if you don't have it installed on our group already.&#x20;

**PS:** This bot will not be used for spams or marketing announcements. Pinky Promise!

## Monitoring

We recommend validators to set up their own monitoring tools and alerts to avoid any downtime. In absence of your own monitoring tools, we suggest using the tool made available by Paranormal Brothers:
