# ðŸŒŸ Introduction

### Problem

The rapid expansion of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions and sidechains has resulted in fragmentation, which negatively impacts BTCfi scalability. This fragmentation makes it challenging for users to seamlessly move assets between different L2s.

### Solution

Persistence One tackles this issue with an intents-based architecture that enables:

* Fast, secure, and zero-slippage cross-chain swaps.
* A more secure and efficient alternative to traditional bridging solutions.

### Mission

Persistence One aims to become the primary gateway for cross-chain BTC swaps, focusing on:

* Simplifying the BTCfi user experience.
* Enhancing interoperability across ecosystems.
