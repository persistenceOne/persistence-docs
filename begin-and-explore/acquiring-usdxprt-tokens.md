* Buy from centralised exchanges like [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/trade/XPRT_USDT), [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/trade/XPRT-USDT), or decentralised exchanges (DEX) like [Swapfast by Leap](https://swapfast.app/?destinationAsset=uxprt\&destinationChainId=core-1\&sourceAsset=0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\&sourceChainId=1), [IBC Transfer from Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/assets/XPRT).
