# Coin-type migration for pWALLET

### TLDR

This guide is for users who have logged into **pWALLET** using Keystore or Mnemonic/Seed-Phrase & want to migrate their 750 coin-type wallet address to 118 coin-type wallet address.



## Step 1: Check which coin-type you're using

If you already have all your tokens on 118 coin-type wallet address then no migration is needed. However if you have funds in your 750 coin-toye wallet address then you need to proceed with the migration (i.e move to [Step 2](coin-type-migration-for-pwallet.md#step-2-migrate-all-the-available-tokens-in-your-wallet)).

***

## Step 2: Migrate all the available tokens in your wallet

{% hint style="info" %}
This step will migrate all the available tokens from 750 coin-type address to 118 coin-type address. If you have staked/delegated tokens in your wallet, we'll migrate them in the _step 3_.
{% endhint %}

A. Claim all the pending staking rewards rewards.

{% endhint %}

**Voila!** All of your available tokens are migrated. Now move to step 3, if you have any staked/Delegated Tokens.

## Step 3: Migrate all the staked/delegated tokens in your wallet



A. Go to '**Staking**' page and select '**Delegated**' from the sub-menu

B. Check if the validator where you stake/delegate your tokens have enough capacity (i.e Validator Bond) to migrate your tokens (using[ Smartstake](https://analytics.smartstake.io/persistence/valbonds) dashboard)

{% hint style="info" %}
Eg: As I delegate \~23 XPRT to smart stake validator, i need to check if smart stake validator has enough capacity to help facilitate migrate for the tokens. As in my case the validator has the capacity, we can move forward with the migation process.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** If your validator doesn't have enough capacity, ask your validator to increase it or redelegate your staked/delegated tokens to a validator which has enough capacity for your tokens.
{% endhint %}



C. Click on '**Actions**'
