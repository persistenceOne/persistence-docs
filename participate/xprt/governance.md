# Governance

## Off-chain Discussions 💬

At Persistence, we firmly believe in an idea-meritocracy, where the most innovative and valuable ideas should always prevail. We rely on our community to actively contribute by generating new ideas, engaging in meaningful discussions, contemplating significant topics, and challenging the existing status quo collectively. To initiate or participate in any discussions, we highly recommend visiting the Persistence Forum, which is linked below:&#x20;

Once certain ideas have gained sufficient support from the community, they can move to the next phase, which is on-chain governance, to decide whether the community of XPRT-stakers agrees on whether this path should be followed or not.

## On-chain Governance ⛓️‍💥

The Persistence Network has an on-chain governance mechanism for passing proposals, changing consensus parameters and spending funds from the community pool

The simplest way to vote currently is through the Keplr Dashboard. The link below will direct you to the governance page for Persistence, where you can view all governance proposals.
