# Stake

As the Persistence chain runs on a delegated [Proof-of-Stake](broken-reference) based Tendermint PBFT consensus engine, staking is integral to ensuring a secure and robust network.&#x20;

This means that [XPRT](./) token holders will be able to delegate their tokens to one of the networks' validators for staking. Stakers will receive [staking rewards](https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/persistence/) in the form of XPRT in return for contributing to the security of the network.&#x20;

### Guides (English)

Ever since XPRT staking went live, multiple guides have been published by ecosystem participants. The below list is not in any particular order, and is provided only for informative purposes, it's not an endorsement for any specific participant or validator.
