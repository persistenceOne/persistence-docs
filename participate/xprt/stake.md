# Stake

As the Persistence chain runs on a delegated [Proof-of-Stake](broken-reference) based Tendermint PBFT consensus engine, staking is integral to ensuring a secure and robust network.&#x20;

This means that [XPRT](./) token holders will be able to delegate their tokens to one of the networks' validators for staking. Stakers will receive [staking rewards](https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/persistence/) in the form of XPRT in return for contributing to the security of the network.&#x20;
