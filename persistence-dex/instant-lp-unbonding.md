# Instant LP Unbonding

## Overview

The Instant LP Unbonding feature is designed to offer Liquidity Providers (LPs) more control over their assets. This feature offers a fast and convenient way for liquidity providers (LPs) to access their liquidity. Normally, withdrawing liquidity involves a 7-day waiting period. However, with this option, LPs can bypass this and get their liquidity immediately. If their liquidity is already in the process of being unbonded, they can also speed up this remaining period. To use this functionality, LPs pay a fee based on the dollar value of their position. This fee is directly deducted from their LP shares, making the process straightforward and efficient. This feature helps strike a balance between providing flexibility to users and ensuring liquidity stability on Persistence DEX.

## Why Use Instant LP Unbonding

* **Immediate Access**: Withdraw your liquidity instantly in times of market crises or emergencies.
* **Risk Mitigation**: The fee structure discourages excessive withdrawals in normal market conditions, which helps maintain a stable liquidity environment, preventing fluctuations that could disrupt overall trading experiences.
* **Gradual Fee Reduction**: ILPU's fee structure adapts based on the remaining unbonding days. If you already have a position being unbonded, the fee gradually decreases as the number of unbonding days left decreases, providing a smoother and more favorable experience for LPs.

## How It Works

The Instant LP Unbonding feature operates on a structured fee tier mechanism, based on the duration of the unlock period. Here's how it works:

* The unlock period is calculated from the time you initiate the unbonding process to the time when your liquidity becomes available for withdrawal.
* The fee you pay for Instant LP Unbonding is determined by this unlock period and falls within predefined fee tiers.
* The longer you are willing to wait for your liquidity, the lower the fee you will be charged.

## Fee Structure

The Instant LP Unbonding feature employs a fee tier mechanism, ensuring fairness and transparency in fee calculation. The key fee parameters are as follows:

* **fee\_tier\_interval:** 86400 seconds (1 day)
* **unlock\_period:** 604800 seconds (7 days)
* **min\_lp\_unbonding\_fee\_bp:** 300 basis points (3%)
