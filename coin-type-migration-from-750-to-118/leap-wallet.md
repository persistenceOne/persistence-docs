## Migration

_Note: Migration is only required if you are using 750 Coin-type wallet address._

### 1. Manual Migration

<details>

<summary>Manually transfer funds from old coin-type [Persistence (old)]  to new coin-type [Persistence (New)].</summary>

In Leap Wallet:

1. Copy the new/118 coin-type wallet persistence address
2. Go to old/750 coin-type wallet persistence address
3. Press "Send" and paste the new/118 coin-type wallet address. Select the full amount and hit "Send".&#x20;

**Note:** If you have multiple tokens in 750 coin-type wallet persistence address, you will have to repeat this step individually for all tokens.

Do you have staked $XPRT in your wallet address?

* **Immediate solution:** Unbond your XPRT and migrate to the newly created coin-type 118 wallet address. (21 days unbonding period)
* **Suggested Migration:** After the Implementation of the Liquid Staking Module by Iqlusion on Persistence _Core-1 Chain_ (Timeline not yet confirmed), the stake can be directly transferred to the new coin-type 118 wallet address without unbonding.
