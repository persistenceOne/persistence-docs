</details>

{% hint style="success" %}
**Note:** If you didn't get the option to select your coin-type, that means that you are already on 118 coin-type & no migration is needed.
{% endhint %}

## Step 2: Make sure you have both the coin-types (750 & 118) wallet addresses added in keplr.&#x20;

In this documentation, we will be denoting <mark style="color:orange;">Wallet 1</mark> as the wallet with 750 coin-type wallet address and <mark style="color:green;">Wallet 2</mark> as the wallet with 118 coin-type wallet address.&#x20;

Hence in this process, we have to move tokens from <mark style="color:orange;">Wallet 1</mark> to <mark style="color:green;">Wallet 2</mark>.

## Step 3: Login to pWALLET with keplr & copy the wallet address&#x20;

* Select <mark style="color:orange;">Wallet 1</mark> from the Keplr Extention

<summary>Step 2: Manually transfer funds from old wallet address to new wallet address.</summary>

In Keplr Extension:

1. Copy the new/118 coin-type wallet persistence address
2. Go to old/750 coin-type wallet persistence address
3. Press "Send" and paste the new/118 coin-type wallet address. Select the full amount and hit "Send".&#x20;

Note: If you have multiple tokens in 750 coin-type wallet persistence address, you will have to repeat this step individually for all tokens.

Do you have staked $XPRT in your wallet address?

* **Immediate solution:** Unbond your XPRT and migrate to the newly created coin-type 118 wallet address. (21 days unbonding period)
* **Suggested Migration:** After the launch of the Liquid Staking Module by Iqlusion (Timeline not yet confirmed), the stake can be directly transferred to the new coin-type 118 wallet address without unbonding.
