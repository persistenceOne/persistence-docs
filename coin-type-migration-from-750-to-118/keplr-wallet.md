<summary>Step 2: Manually transfer funds from old wallet address to new wallet address.</summary>

In Keplr Extension:

1. Copy the new/118 coin-type wallet persistence address
2. Go to old/750 coin-type wallet persistence address
3. Press "Send" and paste the new/118 coin-type wallet address. Select the full amount and hit "Send".&#x20;

Note: If you have multiple tokens in 750 coin-type wallet persistence address, you will have to repeat this step individually for all tokens.

Do you have staked $XPRT in your wallet address?

* **Immediate solution:** Unbond your XPRT and migrate to the newly created coin-type 118 wallet address. (21 days unbonding period)
* **Suggested Migration:** After the launch of the Liquid Staking Module by Iqlusion (Timeline not yet confirmed), the stake can be directly transferred to the new coin-type 118 wallet address without unbonding.
