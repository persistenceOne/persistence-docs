<summary>What do you mean by variation? </summary>

1. Keplr + Ledger

Keplr by default only support 118 coin-type address derivation path for all the addresses generated through keplr since the beginning. Hence if you have always used keplr for your persistence address then you **don't** need wallet migration.&#x20;

2. Persistence App (pWallet) + Ledger

pWALLET by default only support 750 coin-type address derivation path for all the addresses generated through pWALLET since the beginning. Hence if you have always used keplr for your persistence address then you need wallet migration. \
**Note:** As pWALLET only supports 750 coin-type derivation path, so in this migration you'll have to add your ledger wallet in keplr. Steps are mentioned in the next steps.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Still not sure which coin-type you're using?** This is the simplest method to determine:

If you login into pWALLET using Persistence ledger app, then you're on 750 coin-type wallet address.&#x20;

If you login into pWALLET using cosmos ledger app, then you're on 118 coin-type wallet address.
