**Do you have staked $XPRT in your wallet address?**

* **Immediate solution:** Unbond your XPRT and migrate to the newly created coin-type 118 wallet address. (21 days unbonding period)
* **Suggested Migration:** After the launch of the Liquid Staking Module by Iqlusion (Timeline not yet confirmed), the stake can be directly transferred to the new coin-type 118 wallet address without unbonding.
