# Bitcoin Layer 2s

### What are Bitcoin Layer 2s?

Bitcoin Layer 2s (L2s) are solutions built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to:

* Enhance scalability and composability.
* Introduce features that extend Bitcoin’s functionality beyond its native capabilities.

### How Do Bitcoin Layer 2s Work?

* **Independent blockchains:** L2s operate as separate execution layers while leveraging Bitcoin’s base layer for settlement.
* **Transaction processing:** L2s compute transactions and submit the details to Bitcoin’s main layer for consensus.
* **Gas token usage:** Many L2s use BTC as their gas token, maintaining close integration with the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### What do Bitcoin Layer 2s Offer?

* **Enhanced scalability:** Increased transaction throughput compared to the main Bitcoin blockchain.
* **Smart contract capabilities:** L2s introduce programmability, enabling features like DeFi and dApps on Bitcoin.
* **Inheriting Bitcoin’s security:** By using Bitcoin for settlement, L2s benefit from its robust security model.
