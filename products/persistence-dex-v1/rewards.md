# 🏆 Rewards

LPs(Liquidity Providers) can earn rewards for facilitating trades on Persistence DEX. A part of the swap fees is distributed to LPs as a reward. In addition, teams and projects can incentivize LPs with additional incentives for maintaining liquidity for their tokens.

### Bonding 🤝

Liquidity providers need to bond their LP tokens for a period of **7 days** to be eligible for liquidity mining rewards. LPs would still earn rewards from trading fees on unbonded tokens,

**Provide Liquidity -> Mint LP Tokens -> Bond LP Tokens.**

Checkout the guide for providing liquidity and bonding/unbonding tokens here 👇



During unbonding, LP shares are not eligible for external incentives, but would still receive the rewards from trading fees.

### Streaming Rewards 🌊

Liquidity mining rewards on Persistence DEX can be claimed in real time, unlike on an epoch basis in most DEXs

### Multistaking

Multistaking on Persistence DEX allows teams and projects to incentivize liquidity in pools with multiple tokens.
