## Introduction

The "Tradooor Rebate Program" is designed to benefit traders who actively participate in the **stkATOM/ATOM** liquidity pool. Traders can now avail themselves of a significant advantage by receiving a refund on their swap fees. For each trade executed on the pool, traders will be refunded the standard swap fees of **0.3%** and an extra incentive of **0.05%**. These rewards will be distributed in the form of **$XPRT** tokens, which are airdropped directly to the same wallet used for trading activity on a daily epoch basis. The rebate program will run until a cap of **34,500 $XPRT** tokens is reached.
