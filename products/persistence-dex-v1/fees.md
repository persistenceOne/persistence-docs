# ðŸ’° Fees

#### There are two kinds of fees users pay on Persistence DEX: <a href="#there-are-two-kinds-of-fees-users-pay-on-dexter" id="there-are-two-kinds-of-fees-users-pay-on-dexter"></a>

* Transaction Fees
* Swap Fees

#### Transaction Fees <a href="#transaction-fees" id="transaction-fees"></a>

Transaction fees are paid by any user to post a transaction on the chain. The transaction fee is distributed to XPRT stakers on the network as block rewards.

#### Swap Fees <a href="#swap-fees" id="swap-fees"></a>

Swap fees are charged to all traders performing swaps in any of the pools available on Persistence DEX. Swap fees are calculated as a percentage of the swap amount specific to each pool. Swap fees are charged on the input asset of a swap (So if a user swaps ATOM for XPRT, they pay the swap fee in the form of ATOM). This is a configurable parameter decided by the Vault Admin. The default fee is set to 0.3%. The swap fee will be distributed between liquidity providers and the Persistence Community Pool as defined by the Vault Admin.

#### Example <a href="#example" id="example"></a>

Let's say we swap 100 ATOM for XPRT on Persistence DEX, the total fees charged would include the swap fees and the transaction fees.

**Swap Fees** - A 0.3%(about $3 in this case) swap fee will be charged in the input asset, in this case - $ATOM

**Transaction Fees** - A transaction fee will be charged in $XPRT(the native asset of the chain) to execute the swap transaction on the Persistence Core-1 chain.
